PRD-B: Long-Term Project PRD (AI Hiring Platform)
1. Product Vision

Build a multimodal AI candidate screening platform that automates early-stage hiring using video, audio, and NLP-based evaluation, allowing companies to objectively shortlist candidates before human interviews.

2. Target Users

Candidates

Hiring Companies (HR, Recruiters)

Platform Admins

3. Core Value Proposition

Reduce screening time

Improve consistency

Enable data-backed hiring decisions

Act as an AI headhunter

4. System Capabilities (High Level)
4.1 Identity & Integrity

Facial authentication

Liveness detection

Anti-cheating signals

4.2 Interview Intelligence

Speech-to-text

Answer relevance scoring

Behavioral analysis

Confidence & engagement indicators

4.3 Company Platform

Secure multi-tenant access

Job & question management

Candidate analytics dashboard

5. Functional Requirements
5.1 Candidate Interview Engine

Video-based interview

Time-bound responses

Session integrity checks

Behavioral signal extraction

5.2 AI Evaluation Engine

Inputs:

Video

Audio

Transcribed text

Ideal answers (SQL)

Processing:

NLP similarity scoring

Speech fluency analysis

Facial engagement analysis

Outputs:

Question-wise scores

Composite candidate score

Explainable signals

5.3 Company Dashboard

Job creation

Question + answer setup (max 10)

Candidate ranking

Playback of responses

Exportable reports

6. Data Architecture (Long-Term)

Core Tables:

Companies

Users

Jobs

Questions

IdealAnswers

Sessions

Responses

Scores

BehavioralSignals

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Scalable (microservices)

GDPR-compliant

Encrypted media storage

Role-based access control

API-first design

8. Architecture Principles (Critical for You)

Signal capture layer isolated

AI inference stateless

Scoring configurable per company

Media stored separately from metadata

This ensures your demo code becomes the foundation, not throwaway.

9. Long-Term Success Metrics

Screening time reduction

Score vs human agreement

Company retention

Interview completion rate

10. Risk Management

Bias → explainable scores

Privacy → explicit consent + deletion

Model drift → retraining pipeline

How These Two PRDs Connect (Important)
Demo PRD	Long-Term PRD
Camera & audio capture	Signal ingestion layer
Local storage	Cloud object storage
Logs	Feature extraction inputs
No scoring	AI scoring modules

Nothing you build in the demo is wasted.
