## SCRIPT

> **"This is an AI interview system in its first operational stage."**
>
> What you're seeing is the **Signal Capture Stage** — the foundation that makes intelligent hiring possible.
>
> ### What's happening right now:
>
> When a candidate sits in front of this system, we capture:
> - **Video of the interview** — full recording, securely stored
> - **Where their eyes are focused** — are they reading notes, looking away, or engaged?
> - **How they move** — calm and composed, or showing signs of nervousness?
> - **When they speak** — confident responses, or hesitation?
>
> You'll notice the **Interview Context** panel — this tells us what type of interview, what role, what stage. In production, this drives the question flow.
>
> ### Integrity monitoring:
>
> The **Session Integrity** block shows binary signals:
> - Is the candidate's face continuously visible?
> - Did we detect multiple faces?
> - Were there audio interruptions?
>
> These aren't judgments — they're data points for later review.
>
> ### What's intentionally disabled:
>
> See the **Evaluation Pipeline** at the bottom? It's greyed out.
>
> That's deliberate.
>
> - Speech-to-text: **Not active**
> - Answer scoring: **Not active**
> - Behavioral analysis: **Not active**
> - Composite scoring: **Not active**
>
> This demo captures signals. **Evaluation comes in Stage 2.**
>
> ### Why this matters:
>
> Look at the **Candidate Lifecycle** strip:
>
> **Capture → Analysis → Review → Shortlist**
>
> We're at Capture. This is the hardest layer to get right.
>
> Every AI hiring platform that failed, failed here — at the sensor layer.
> Noisy signals produce biased scores. Clean signals enable fair evaluation.
>
> We built this first. The intelligence comes next.
>
> ### The bottom line:
>
> This is **Stage 1 of an AI-powered hiring system**.
>
> - Stage 1: Capture (you're seeing it now)
> - Stage 2: Analysis (speech, behavior, relevance)
> - Stage 3: Review (recruiter dashboard)
> - Stage 4: Shortlist (ranked candidates)
>
> **The architecture is ready. The foundation is proven. The roadmap is clear.**
