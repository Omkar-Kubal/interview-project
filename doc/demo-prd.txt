PRD-A: Short-Term Demo PRD (Signal Capture MVP)
1. Product Purpose

Demonstrate the technical feasibility of capturing visual and audio behavioral signals from candidates using a webcam and microphone, and storing them locally per user.
No AI judgment, no scoring, no hiring logic.

2. Scope (Strictly Limited)
✅ In Scope

Camera-based face + eye movement detection

Microphone-based voice activity detection

Local storage of:

Video

Audio

Movement & voice logs

Per-user session isolation

❌ Out of Scope

Speech-to-text

Facial emotion inference

Scoring or ranking

Cloud storage

Company accounts

Security hardening

3. Users

Candidate (Demo User)

Demo Operator (You / Stakeholder)

4. User Flow

User enters User ID

Clicks Start Session

System activates:

Webcam

Microphone

System continuously:

Detects face presence

Tracks eye & head movement

Detects voice activity

User clicks Stop Session

Data saved locally under user folder

5. Functional Requirements
5.1 Camera Module

Detect face presence per frame

Track:

Eye blinks

Eye direction (left / right / center)

Head movement intensity (low / medium / high)

Record video stream

Outputs:

video.mp4

face_log.json

5.2 Audio Module

Capture microphone input

Detect:

Voice vs silence

Speaking duration

Average volume

Save raw audio

Outputs:

audio.wav

audio_log.json

5.3 Data Storage (Local)
/data/
  /user_<id>/
    video.mp4
    audio.wav
    face_log.json
    audio_log.json
    session_meta.json

6. Non-Functional Requirements

Real-time processing (≥15 FPS)

Runs on a single laptop

No internet dependency

Failure-safe recording

7. Tech Constraints (Demo)

Python only

OpenCV / MediaPipe

PyAudio or SoundDevice

JSON-based logs

8. Demo Success Criteria

Camera reliably tracks face & eyes

Voice activity detected correctly

Files saved cleanly per user

Can replay session artifacts

9. Demo Positioning Statement

“This demo captures raw behavioral signals that will later power AI-driven hiring intelligence.”
